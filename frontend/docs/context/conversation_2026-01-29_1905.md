## Current Task
Adding final polish to History page - network status bar with blinking cursor divider and auto-incrementing block number.

## Completed This Session

### History Page Redesign
- Implemented 2-column layout (transactions table + sidebar)
- Search box with terminal `>` prompt
- Filter tabs (ALL, SHIELD, WITHDRAW, SWAP)
- Transaction table with TYPE, AMOUNT, TX_HASH, STATUS, TIME columns
- Quick Commands, Statistics, Activity Log, Export sections in sidebar
- All sidebar sections have consistent gradient container styling with top edge glow

### Staggered Entrance Animations (All Pages)
- Shield, Unshield, Private Swap, History pages have staggered line-by-line animations
- Animation pattern: `initial={{ opacity: 0, scale: 0.9 }}`, cubic-bezier `[0.16, 1, 0.3, 1]`
- Staggered delays: base delay + (index * 0.08)

## Current Changes Requested
1. Add network status bar: "● Devnet | Block 234,891,026"
   - Divider is blinking cursor
   - Block number increments by 1 every 3 seconds
2. Recent activity container should span full width (left to right)
3. Remove green border around the shielding command
