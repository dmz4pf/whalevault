# Context Snapshot - WhaleVault Frontend
**Date:** 2026-01-30 14:30
**Context Usage:** 85%+

## Current Task
Implement a fullscreen transaction loading modal similar to Infinex swap interface:
- Blur background when transaction is processing
- Show only the loading modal in focus
- Apply to all transaction flows (shield, unshield, swap)

## Key Decisions Made (Previous Session)
- Privacy % calculation: `shieldedBalance / (walletBalanceLamports + shieldedBalance)`
- Background animation: Use `clearRect` instead of semi-transparent fill to avoid black bands
- Landing page renamed to "home" for better UX
- Splash page animations slowed down (0.8-1.8s delays with cubic-bezier easing)

## Implementation State
- [x] Dashboard privacy % calculation fixed
- [x] ProofAnimation component alignment fixed
- [x] Background black bands removed
- [x] Splash page entrance animations added
- [x] Landing → Home rename completed
- [x] Deployed to Vercel (commit d5240ab)
- [ ] Transaction loading modal (current task)

## Files Modified Previous Session
- `frontend/app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Privacy % calculation
- `frontend/components/proof/ProofAnimation.tsx` - Alignment fix
- `frontend/components/effects/BinaryRain.tsx` - clearRect fix
- `frontend/app/page.tsx` - Splash animations
- `frontend/app/home/` - Renamed from landing
- `frontend/components/layout/Header.tsx` - /home links
- `frontend/components/wallet/WalletRedirect.tsx` - /home redirects

## Next Steps
1. Create TransactionModal component with blur overlay
2. Integrate with shield/unshield/swap transaction flows
3. Match Infinex-style design (centered modal, blurred background)
