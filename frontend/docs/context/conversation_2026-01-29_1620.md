# Context Snapshot - WhaleVault V6 Terminal UI
**Date:** 2026-01-29 16:20
**Context Usage:** 85%+

## Current Tasks (Pending)

### 1. Entrance Animations - Staggered Line-by-Line
- Pages should have lines appearing one by one (staggered animation)
- NOT everything entering at once
- Check design HTML files for animation patterns

### 2. Card Scaling - Shield/Unshield/Swap Pages
- Current card is too zoomed in (content too large)
- Need to scale down to match design reference
- More space between card edges and page edges
- Current: `max-w-[900px]` - may need adjustment or padding reduction

### 3. History Page - Rebuild from HTML Reference
- Current history page was built from scratch
- Should use: `/Users/MAC/Desktop/dev/whalevault/whalevault-history.html`
- Will implement after scaling fixes
