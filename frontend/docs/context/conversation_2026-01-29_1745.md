## Current Task
Fixing UI issues across pages:
1. Sort positions by most recent first (timestamp descending)
2. Improve position card presentation (user called current design "tacky")

## Completed This Session
- Fixed race condition in `usePrivateSwap` - added `isSwappingRef` to prevent double-execution from rapid clicks
- Removed auto-fill of recipient address on private-swap page (now starts empty)

## Key Files Modified
- `frontend/hooks/usePrivateSwap.ts` - Added isSwappingRef for race condition fix
- `frontend/app/private-swap/page.tsx` - Removed recipient auto-fill

## Next Steps
1. Sort `shieldedPositions` by timestamp descending in:
   - `/app/private-swap/page.tsx`
   - `/app/unshield/page.tsx`
   - Any other pages showing positions
2. Redesign position cards for cleaner look

## Design Direction
- Current: Rounded cards with icon, token name, badge, date, amount
- User wants: Cleaner, less "tacky" presentation
