**Context Usage:** ~1088%

## Current Task
Fixing remaining V6 Terminal UI issues after comparing implementation to design mockups.

## Issues Identified from Screenshots

### Header Issues:
1. Logo should be "> whalevault" (lowercase) NOT "WHALEVAULT" (uppercase)
2. The ">" must have blinking animation
3. Nav items should be UPPERCASE: SHIELD, WITHDRAW, SWAP, HISTORY
4. Remove "Dashboard" and "Private Yield Soon" from nav

### Hero Section Issues:
1. Terminal window needs typing animation (character-by-character)
2. Blinking cursor after "private transactions" text
3. Brand "WHALEVAULT" needs much larger letter-spacing (like design shows)

### Stats Section Issues:
1. Should show demo numbers: $847M, 42,589, 156,204, 2.3s
2. Labels: TOTAL SHIELDED, USERS, TRANSACTIONS, FINALITY

### Features Section Issues:
1. Titles should be function-style: `shield{}`, `stealth_withdraw{}`, `private_swap{}`
2. Different commands in code boxes
3. Different descriptions

### Animations Missing:
1. Blinking ">" on logo
2. Terminal typing animation
3. Title/heading typing animation on page load
4. Scroll reveal fly-in animations NOT working

### Styling/Colors:
1. Green needs slight adjustment
2. Background texture/grid more prominent in design
3. Font weights may differ

## Completed Work (Phase 1-7)
- Routes restructured (splash at `/`, landing at `/landing`)
- Navigation styling updated (but needs more changes per design)
- Color rgba values fixed
- Typography partially fixed
- Animation hooks exist but not fully integrated

## Files to Modify
1. `/frontend/components/layout/Header.tsx` - Logo, nav styling
2. `/frontend/app/landing/page.tsx` - Hero, stats, features content
3. `/frontend/app/page.tsx` - Splash page animations
4. `/frontend/hooks/useTerminalTyping.ts` - Terminal typing effect
5. `/frontend/app/globals.css` - Animations, effects

## Design Reference Files
- `/Users/MAC/Desktop/dev/whalevault/whalevault-landing.html`
- `/Users/MAC/Desktop/dev/whalevault/whalevault-styles.css`
- `/Users/MAC/Desktop/dev/whalevault/whalevault-scripts.js`

## Next Steps
1. Enter plan mode
2. Read design reference files for exact specs
3. Create comprehensive remediation plan
4. Assign to custom agents
