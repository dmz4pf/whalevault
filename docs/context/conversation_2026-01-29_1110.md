## Current Task
Finalize unshield flow with batching. Explain feasibility.

## Features Status
| Feature | Status | Effort |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Fixed Privacy Levels (1,6,12,24h) | ✅ Done | - |
| Recipient: Manual Address | ✅ Done | - |
| Recipient: Stealth Address | ✅ UI Done | Backend needed |
| Recipient: Split to Many | 🔜 Coming Soon | Circuit changes |
| Batched Transactions | 📋 To implement | Backend queue |

## Batching Feasibility
**Easy to implement** - no circuit changes needed:
1. Frontend: User selects delay (1,6,12,24h)
2. Backend: Queue stores pending unshields
3. Relayer: Processes queue when batch is ready (time or count threshold)
4. All queued txns submitted together → timing privacy

## Files Modified This Session
- `frontend/app/shield/page.tsx` - Removed PrivacyDelay
- `frontend/app/unshield/page.tsx` - Full rebuild with actions, recipient options, timing
- `frontend/components/shield/PrivacyDelay.tsx` - Fixed intervals

## Implementation Plan for Batching
1. Backend: Create `UnshieldQueue` table/store
2. Backend: Queue endpoint to add pending unshields
3. Backend: Worker that processes batches (by time or count)
4. Frontend: Show "Queued" status, estimated batch time
