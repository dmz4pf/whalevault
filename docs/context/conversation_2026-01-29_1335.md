## Current Task
Fixing remaining UI/UX issues after V6 Terminal UI Round 2 completion.

## Issues Identified (Round 3)

### 1. Performance
- App is slow - need to use Turbopack
- Dev server currently running without `--turbopack` flag

### 2. Scroll Animations
- Should restart when scrolling past (up/down)
- Currently using `once: true` in useScrollReveal
- Need to change to `once: false`

### 3. Nav Bar Issues
- Fonts and positioning are off from original design
- Architecture was changed - need to restore original styling

### 4. Typing Animation
- Should restart on EVERY page reload
- Currently using localStorage caching (shows instant on return visit)
- Need to remove localStorage check

### 5. Wallet Connection Flow
- After connecting wallet, redirect to dashboard
- On disconnect, redirect back to home page
- Launch app button should lead to dashboard
- Connect wallet buttons should disappear when wallet connected

## Files to Modify
1. `/frontend/components/effects/TerminalTyping.tsx` - Remove localStorage
2. `/frontend/hooks/useScrollReveal.ts` - Change once: false
3. `/frontend/components/layout/Header.tsx` - Fix nav styling
4. `/frontend/app/landing/page.tsx` - Wallet connection logic, button visibility
5. Dev server - Restart with Turbopack

## Completed Work (Round 1-2)
- Routes restructured (splash at `/`, landing at `/landing`)
- Header logo transformed to "> whalevault" lowercase
- Nav items: SHIELD, WITHDRAW, SWAP, HISTORY only
- Terminal typing animation created
- Stats with demo values
- Features with function-style names
- Footer added
- Stagger CSS classes added

## Key Files
- `/frontend/components/layout/Header.tsx`
- `/frontend/app/landing/page.tsx`
- `/frontend/components/effects/TerminalTyping.tsx`
- `/frontend/hooks/useScrollReveal.ts`
