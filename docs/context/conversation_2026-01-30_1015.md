# Context Snapshot - WhaleVault Deployment Complete
**Date:** 2026-01-30 10:15
**Status:** Deployment successful, UI fixes needed

## Deployment Complete
- **Frontend**: https://whalevault.vercel.app (LIVE)
- **Backend**: https://whalevault-production.up.railway.app (LIVE)
- Health check: "degraded" (RPC timeout, but functional)

## Dockerfile Evolution (for reference)
1. Rust 1.75 → 1.83 → nightly (for edition2024)
2. Python 3.11 conflict → install Python 3.12 from source in build stage
3. Final: Rust nightly + Python 3.12 both stages

## Current Issue
User reports:
1. Mock data for pool deposits is gone (shows "0 deposits")
2. UI/UX of denomination selector needs improvement

## Files to Fix
- `frontend/components/shield/DenominationSelector.tsx` - Add mock data, improve UI
