# Context Snapshot - Root Cause Found
**Date:** 2026-01-28 16:20

## ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED
The 500 error on /api/relay/unshield was NOT a code bug.

**Error:** `Allocate: account already in use` - the nullifier account exists on-chain

**Meaning:** The position was already unshielded earlier. The on-chain transaction succeeded, but the UI crashed before updating local state. User is trying to re-unshield an already-spent position.

## Solution
1. Clear the stale "ghost" position from UI
2. Shield fresh SOL
3. Test private swap with the new position

## V5 Status
- Code is likely working correctly
- Issue was state desync between UI and blockchain
- Need fresh position to properly test
